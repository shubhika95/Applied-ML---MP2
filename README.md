# Applied-ML

I have worked with logistic regression, KNN, naive bayes.
Decision tree is pending

Worked with 2 sets of database for handwritten digits: sklearn-load_digits and sklearn-openML

For extra: i would be using another toy dataset for the same and compare their precision and accuracy.

Pending:
KNN (for openML dataset)
Decision tree
Toy dataset for all of the classifiers (or as much as possible-maybe 2 to draw some conclusion)

Would be done by tomorrow for the codes.
