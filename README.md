# Applied-ML

I have worked with logistic regression, KNN, naive bayes.
Decision tree is pending

Worked with 2 sets of database for handwritten digits: sklearn-load_digits and sklearn-openML

For extra: i would be using another toy dataset for the same and compare their precision and accuracy.

Pending:
KNN (for openML dataset)
Decision tree
Toy dataset for all of the classifiers (or as much as possible-maybe 2 to draw some conclusion)

Would be done by tomorrow for the codes.


There is one more training file for openML dataset (but it was more than 25mb, so didnt upload here currently) --> this is for openML dataset, since it is huge set of data for handwritten digits, it was getting difficult to import, so tried a different method
