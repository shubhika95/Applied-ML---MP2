# Applied-ML

I have worked with logistic regression, KNN, naive bayes, decision tree and random forest.

Worked with 2 sets of database for handwritten digits: sklearn-load_digits and sklearn-openML

Toy dataset for all of the classifiers (or as much as possible-maybe 2 to draw some conclusion) --> couldnt get to import this. Anyways it was another step, thats all. For optional and creativity, we can present working of various classifiers on 2 datasets.

There is one more training file for openML dataset (but it was more than 25mb, so didnt upload here currently) --> this is for openML dataset, since it is huge set of data for handwritten digits, it was getting difficult to import, so tried a different method
